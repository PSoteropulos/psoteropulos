# Hello World! ✌

I'm Paul Soteropulos, a certified Full Stack Developer with a passion for building, solving problems, and learning.

## About Me
- 🌱 Full Stack Developer with a focus on creating fun, engaging, and meaningful applications.
- 🏫 Teaching and coding the days away at Coding Dojo's Web Dev bootcamp. It is wild how much you get to ***LEARN*** while teaching.

- 🔭 Working on several projects like [moodRING](https://github.com/psoteropulos/moodRING), [CookBook](https://github.com/psoteropulos/CookBook-Group-Project), AIsop (sorry friends, private repo), and more that are not *quite* ready to share.

## Skills
